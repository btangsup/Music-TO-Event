## Introduction
This application is a ReactJS website that allows users to search for live music events specifically in Toronto. Users can filter the genre to their liking and it'll display upcoming events based on the genre. I created this application because I wanted to develop something that I would personally use (but I hope other people can use it too!)

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
